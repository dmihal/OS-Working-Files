Problem 2 Explanation

Phase 1:

In this scenario, the intersection is controlled using semaphores. Each car is 
represented as a thread, each taking its turn entering the critical region (aka the 
intersection). Each car takes its turn arriving at the intersection, calls wait on a 
semaphore and waits its turn, then proceeds to go through the intersection, and calls 
post on the semaphore to allow the next driver to do the same. This method is suboptimal 
because it only allows one driver to go through the intersection at a time. If there is a 
driver coming from the North wanting to turn right, and a driver coming from the South 
wanting to turn right, they should both be able to do so without stopping.


Phase 2:

If two drivers are approaching the intersection from opposing directions and both are
trying to make left turns, and if they both lock 2 of the 3 spaces needed to complete the
turn and they're both waiting to unlock the 3rd one, it will cause a deadlock.
